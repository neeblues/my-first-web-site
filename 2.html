<p style="margin-top:45px;">Track suits and red wine
    Movies for two
    We'll take off our phones
    And we'll turn off our shoes
    We'll play Nintendo
    Though I always lose
    'Cause you'll watch the TV
    While I'm watching you
    There's not many people
    I'd honestly say
    I don't mind losing to
    But there's nothing
    Like doing nothing
    With you</p>
<p style="margin-top:45px;">Dumb conversations
    We lose track of time
    Have I told you lately
    I'm grateful you're mine?
    We'll watch The Notebook
    For the seventeenth time
    I'll say, it's stupid
    Then you'll catch me crying
    We're not making out
    On a boat in the rain
    Or in a house I've painted blue
    But there's nothing
    Like doing nothing
    With you</p>
